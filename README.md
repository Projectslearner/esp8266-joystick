# ESP8266 Joystick Project

#### Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to interface a joystick module with an ESP8266 microcontroller to read and display joystick movements and button presses. The joystick provides two axes (X and Y) and a button for various input controls, making it suitable for a range of applications such as remote control, gaming, and robotics.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **Joystick Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard (optional)**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Joystick Module:**
   - **VRx (X-axis):** Connect to the analog pin A0 on the ESP8266.
   - **VRy (Y-axis):** Connect to the digital pin D1 on the ESP8266 (simulated as an analog input).
   - **SW (Button):** Connect to the digital pin D2 on the ESP8266.
   - **VCC:** Connect to the 3.3V pin on the ESP8266.
   - **GND:** Connect to the GND pin on the ESP8266.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
   - Open the Serial Monitor to view joystick movements and button states.

2. **Testing:**
   - Move the joystick along the X and Y axes.
   - Press the joystick button.
   - Observe the corresponding values printed to the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications
- **Remote Control:** Use the joystick to control robots, drones, or other remote devices.
- **Gaming:** Integrate the joystick into DIY gaming controllers for a custom gaming experience.
- **User Interfaces:** Implement the joystick in projects requiring intuitive user input.

#### Notes
- **Analog Read:** The ESP8266 has a single analog pin (A0); ensure correct wiring and code adjustment for any additional analog inputs.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure a stable power supply to the ESP8266 and joystick module for consistent operation.
- **Debouncing:** Consider software debouncing for the joystick button if experiencing noise in readings.
